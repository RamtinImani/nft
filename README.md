# Responsive NFT Landing Page

This project is a responsive NFT landing page built with Bootstrap 5. I created this page to practice and demonstrate my skills with the Bootstrap framework, specifically focusing on the use of Bootstrap components, layout structures, grid system, and responsive features. The design incorporates modern elements and a clean, organized structure to showcase an engaging NFT marketplace interface.

## ✨ Features:
- **Fully Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Bootstrap Components**: Utilizes Bootstrap 5 components for buttons, cards, navigation, and other UI elements.
- **Grid System**: Implemented Bootstrap’s grid system for a structured and balanced layout.
- **Practice Project**: This project served as hands-on practice with Bootstrap, helping to reinforce my knowledge of its classes, utilities, and responsive design capabilities.

Feel free to check out the code and explore how Bootstrap was used to create this visually appealing and fully responsive NFT landing page.
